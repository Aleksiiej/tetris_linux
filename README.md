# C++ Tetris Game Project with SFML
## Project Overview
This project is a reimagining of the iconic Tetris game, developed in C++ using the object-oriented programming paradigm. A key aspect of this project was integrating the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) to manage graphical elements, aiming to both refine my C++ programming skills and familiarize myself with SFML.
