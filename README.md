# C++ Tetris Game Project with SFML
## Project Overview
This project is a reimagining of the iconic Tetris game, developed in C++ using the object-oriented programming paradigm. A key aspect of this project was integrating the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) to manage graphical elements, aiming to both refine my C++ programming skills and familiarize myself with SFML.

## Key Features:
- Object-Oriented Approach: Utilizes object-oriented programming in C++, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
- SFML Graphics: Incorporates SFML for rendering graphics, handling events, and managing audio, showcasing the library's capabilities in a game development context.
- Linux Compatibility: Optimized for Linux platforms, demonstrating the ability to create cross-platform C++ applications.
- Engaging Gameplay: Offers a classic Tetris experience with a modern twist, providing both challenge and entertainment.

## Technical Stack:
- Language: C++
- Graphics Library: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, CMake
- Platform: Linux

## Project Goals:
- C++ Proficiency: Aimed at advancing C++ programming expertise, particularly in game development and graphics handling.
- SFML Exploration: Gained practical experience with SFML, learning to integrate and utilize its features effectively.
- Educational Pursuit: Served as a learning project to understand the nuances of combining graphics, audio, and gameplay logic in C++.
- Personal Satisfaction: Fulfilled a personal interest in game development, creating a game from the ground up.

## Getting Started:
